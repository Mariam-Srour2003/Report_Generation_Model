# Report_Generation_Model
Final year project by Mariam Srour, Aya Haydous, and Hiba Rezek: an X-Ray report generator using machine learning models. We built a user-friendly interface with .NET and Angular, and collected data from Al-Zahraa and Bahman hospitals. The project involved data preprocessing, translation, and report generation.
